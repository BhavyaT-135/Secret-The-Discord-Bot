# SECRET Discord Bot :space_invader:

We created a Discord multi-purpose bot named ‚ÄúSECRET‚Äù using python as our central programming language.

SECRET can perform a wide range of tasks that include some responsive **test functions** :eyes:, an **8-Ball trivia game** :8ball:, performing **admin rights functions** :oncoming_police_car:, a fully functioning **music player** :musical_note: that uses YouTube as its search platform, a **token-rank feature** :chart_with_upwards_trend: based on user activity, an **interactive AI chatbot** :speech_balloon: feature, **Wikipedia search** :mag: and some **developer functions** :busts_in_silhouette: for better performance.

> P.S. Our bot has been succesfully deployed and you can fork this repository, download and run the code as and when you feel like enjoying all the cool features of the bot! :innocent:
